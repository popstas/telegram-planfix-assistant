"""Shared Telethon client wrapper.

Exposes a single async Telethon client that is shared by the HTTP API, the
CLI, and the background worker. Loading is lazy: callers obtain the client
through :func:`get_client`, which constructs (and connects) it on first use
and reuses it on subsequent calls within the same event loop.
