"""Helpers for translating Telethon RPC errors to the queue's signal types.

Telethon raises its own ``FloodWaitError`` from ``telethon.errors``; the worker
queue only pauses-and-retries when it sees the project's own
``worker.queue.FloodWaitError``. Backends that talk to Telethon must therefore
translate the upstream exception so the queue can react instead of marking the
operation as a generic failure.
