"""Folder-domain functions shared by HTTP, CLI, and the worker.

The functions in this module never auto-create a folder. Missing folders raise
:class:`FolderNotFoundError`; ``folder_id`` cross-check mismatches raise
:class:`FolderIdMismatchError`. Per-peer folder failures (e.g. the underlying
``UpdateDialogFilterRequest`` raising mid-batch) raise
:class:`FolderPeerFailureError`, which the worker layer turns into a
``needs_review`` outcome rather than a silent success.
