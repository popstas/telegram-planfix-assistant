"""Lifespan-driven session-manager wiring tests.

The FastAPI factory auto-constructs a :class:`TelethonSessionManager` from
config when no manager is passed (the production uvicorn path). The lifespan
context manager then drives ``get_client()`` on startup and ``disconnect()``
on shutdown. Without the auto-construct the service would come up
permanently unauthorized, which is the bug Task 18 surfaced.
