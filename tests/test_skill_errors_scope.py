"""Tests for the error/clarification/scope guidance in ``SKILL.md``.

Task 7 of ``docs/plans/20260519-telegram-skill-and-dry-run.md`` adds
three new sections to the skill: a list of situations where the agent
must stop and ask, a short catalogue of clarification templates, and an
explicit "out of scope" list. This module pins those sections so future
edits cannot quietly drop them or let a real identifier slip into an
example.
