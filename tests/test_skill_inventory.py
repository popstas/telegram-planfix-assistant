"""Inventory guard: SKILL.md must list every CLI command and vice versa.

This is a cheap structural check that catches drift between the actual
Typer CLI in ``cli/main.py`` and the resource/action catalog inside
``skills/telegram-planfix-assistant/SKILL.md``. Whenever a new CLI
subcommand is added (or removed), the skill catalog must be updated in
the same change.

Two directions are asserted:

1. Every CLI command (top-level + grouped) appears in the SKILL.md
   catalog table, unless it is on the ``EXCLUDED_FROM_SKILL`` allowlist
   (infrastructure-only commands that the agent never invokes).
2. Every SKILL.md catalog row resolves to a real Typer command in the
   CLI — no stale entries.
