"""Structural tests for ``skills/telegram-planfix-assistant/SKILL.md``.

Task 5 of ``docs/plans/20260519-telegram-skill-and-dry-run.md`` introduces
the agent skill. This module pins the skeleton that later tasks (6, 7,
8) will build on: the YAML front-matter must be present and have the
required fields, and the body must cover the foundational rules — config
location, ``health`` liveness check, CLI-only interface, the 11-step
algorithm, ``/tmp`` rules for bulk files, and the confirmation policy.

Per-scenario content for individual resource/action pairs is asserted in
later task-specific tests, so this module intentionally checks only the
skeleton.
