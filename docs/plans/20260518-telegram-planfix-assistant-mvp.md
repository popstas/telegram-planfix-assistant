# telegram-planfix-assistant MVP

## Overview

Build `telegram-planfix-assistant` — a Telegram automation service for the Planfix ↔ Telegram integration. It exposes three interfaces over one domain layer: an HTTP API (primary entry point for Planfix and automations), a CLI that mirrors every HTTP endpoint for manual and batch use, and a worker/queue that performs Telegram operations with throttling and `FLOOD_WAIT` handling.

The service runs on MTProto via Telethon under a technical Telegram user account, because the Bot API cannot create supergroups, add users before a dialog is started, or perform several other administrative actions this project needs. It must support creating client supergroups with topics enabled, placing them into a configured Telegram chat folder, generating invite links, adding `@planfix_bot` and reserve accounts, bulk membership changes, bulk topic creation, topic closing, and structured message sending — all with idempotency, queueing, and `FLOOD_WAIT` resilience.

## Context

- Adopted from `docs/init-plan.md` (Russian-language technical specification, ~875 lines).
- Out of scope: Planfix-side objects/fields/scenarios, replacing `@planfix_bot`, business-status logic for services, WhatsApp, per-topic access control (Telegram does not support it).
- Stack: Python 3.12+, Telethon (MTProto), FastAPI (or equivalent), SQLite for operation state, Docker image, config at `data/config.yml`.
- The `data/` directory must be in `.gitignore`; it holds the Telethon session, SQLite database, and secrets.
- HTTP default port: `8085`. Bearer-token auth.
- Telegram chat folder is configured in `data/config.yml` by `folder_name` (with optional `folder_id` cross-check) and must already exist — the service must never auto-create folders.
- Idempotency states: `pending`, `completed`, `failed`, `needs_review`. Operations that have an undefined outcome after timeout become `needs_review` and are not auto-retried.
- Use `.venv` for the Python virtual environment.

## Development Approach

- Testing approach: regular (write tests for every feature; integration tests against a Telegram test contour where feasible)
- Complete each task fully before moving to the next
- Share one domain layer between HTTP, CLI, and worker — never duplicate logic across surfaces
- Update this plan when scope changes during implementation

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests required for every code-changing task
- Integration tests for Telegram interactions should run against a dedicated test contour: technical account, reserve technical account, test chat folder, `@planfix_bot`, 2-3 test users, a test group
- Run project tests after each task before proceeding
- Final task runs the full suite, the linter, and walks the MVP acceptance checklist from the source spec

## Progress Tracking

- Mark completed items with `[x]` immediately when done
- Update plan if implementation deviates from original scope

## Technical Details

### Configuration shape (`data/config.yml`)

```yaml
telegram:
  api_id: 123456
  api_hash: "telegram_api_hash"
  session_path: /data/telegram-planfix-assistant.session
  main_account_label: planfix-assistant-main
  reserve_admins:
    - "@reserve_account"
  reserve_members:
    - "@planfix_bot"
  default_chat_folder:
    folder_id: 2
    folder_name: "Planfix clients"
  defaults:
    enable_topics: true
    create_invite_link: true

http:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8085
  bearer_token: "secret_token"

queue:
  max_parallel_telegram_ops: 1
  default_retry_delay_seconds: 30
  flood_wait_safety_margin_seconds: 5

logging:
  level: INFO
```

### Idempotency keys

- Group create: `planfix_task_id` if present, else `title`
- Topic create: `planfix_task_id` if present, else `telegram_chat_id + topic_name`
- Bulk item: `operation_id + per-item key (planfix_task_id / topic_name / user)`
- Topic close: `telegram_chat_id + telegram_topic_id`
- Member add/remove: `telegram_chat_id + user`

### HTTP endpoints

- `POST /telegram/groups` — create group
- `POST /telegram/topics` — create single topic
- `POST /telegram/topics/bulk-create` — bulk topic creation
- `POST /telegram/topics/{topic_id}/close` — close topic
- `POST /telegram/groups/{chat_id}/members/bulk-add` — bulk add members
- `POST /telegram/groups/{chat_id}/members/bulk-remove` — bulk remove members
- `POST /telegram/messages` — send message/command, supports mass mode (folder + topic name)
- `GET /telegram/folders/{folder_name}` — inspect folder
- `POST /telegram/folders/{folder_name}/chats` — move chat into folder
- `GET /health` — healthcheck

### CLI shape

Every HTTP endpoint has a CLI counterpart:

```
telegram-planfix-assistant <resource> <action> [options]
```

Plus CLI-only commands:

- `telegram-planfix-assistant auth` — interactive Telethon login
- `telegram-planfix-assistant operations status --operation-id <id>`
- `telegram-planfix-assistant operations retry --operation-id <id>`

CLI conventions:

- `--folder-name` falls back to `telegram.default_chat_folder.folder_name`
- `--chat-name` + `--folder-name` resolves to `chat_id` by exact title match within the folder; ambiguous matches must fail loudly with the list of matches
- `--topic-name` resolves to `topic_id` within the selected chat
- `--no-reserve` disables adding configured `reserve_admins`/`reserve_members`
- Destructive bulk commands support `--dry-run`, require `--yes` unless explicitly confirmed, and require `--force` to touch technical accounts or `@planfix_bot`

### Error taxonomy

The service must distinguish: user not found, user blocked by privacy settings, user already present, user not present, no admin rights, chat not found, topic not found, folder not found, Telethon session unauthorized, Telegram `FLOOD_WAIT`, undefined-outcome timeout (`needs_review`).

### Structured logging fields

`operation_id`, HTTP request ID or CLI invocation ID, `planfix_task_id`, `chat_name`, `topic_name`, `telegram_chat_id`, `telegram_topic_id`, operation type, bulk item, result, error, duration.

### Minimum alerting hooks

Telethon session unauthorized, repeated `FLOOD_WAIT` in a row, stuck bulk operation, operation moved to `needs_review`, default chat folder unavailable, error rate above threshold.

## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Project scaffolding

- [x] create Python 3.12+ project layout under `src/telegram_planfix_assistant/`
- [x] create `.venv` and pin dependencies (Telethon, FastAPI or equivalent, uvicorn, pydantic, SQLAlchemy or sqlite-utils, click/typer for CLI, structlog)
- [x] add `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent) with `telegram-planfix-assistant` CLI entrypoint
- [x] add `.gitignore` excluding `data/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, build artifacts
- [x] add config loader for `data/config.yml` with validation and clear error messages
- [x] add FastAPI app skeleton with bearer-token auth middleware reading `http.bearer_token` from config
- [x] add CLI skeleton with subcommand groups: `auth`, `health`, `groups`, `topics`, `members`, `messages`, `folders`, `operations`
- [x] write tests for config loader (valid file, missing keys, missing file)
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 2: Telethon session and `auth` CLI

- [x] implement Telethon session wrapper reading `api_id`, `api_hash`, `session_path` from config
- [x] implement `telegram-planfix-assistant auth` interactive login (phone, code, optional 2FA password) writing session to configured path
- [x] make re-running `auth` show the current authorized account and not re-prompt unnecessarily
- [x] expose a single shared Telethon client used by HTTP, CLI, and worker
- [x] write tests for session state detection (unauthorized vs authorized) using mock Telethon client
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 3: Healthcheck (HTTP + CLI)

- [x] implement `GET /health` returning `status`, `telegram_session` (`authorized`/`unauthorized`), `database` (`ok`/`error`), `default_folder` (`ok`/`missing`)
- [x] implement `telegram-planfix-assistant health` CLI returning the same payload
- [x] add startup probe so the service responds to `/health` even when Telegram is reachable but session is unauthorized
- [x] write tests covering all health states (session authorized/unauthorized, DB ok/error, folder ok/missing)
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 4: Persistence and idempotency layer

- [x] design SQLite schema: `operations` (id, type, status, request_payload, result_payload, error, created_at, updated_at), `operation_items` (id, operation_id, idempotency_key, status, result, error), `idempotency_index` (key, operation_id)
- [x] implement migrations or schema bootstrap on startup
- [x] implement state machine: `pending` → `completed` | `failed` | `needs_review`
- [x] implement replay semantics: `completed` returns saved result, `pending` waits up to a configured timeout or returns 503, `failed` returns saved error, `needs_review` does not auto-retry
- [x] implement idempotency-key computation per operation type as defined in Technical Details
- [x] write tests for replay of each state, for duplicate-key collision behavior, and for the per-item idempotency in bulk operations
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 5: Queue and worker with `FLOOD_WAIT` handling

- [x] implement async worker queue with bounded parallelism (`queue.max_parallel_telegram_ops`)
- [x] handle `FLOOD_WAIT` as a graceful pause respecting `flood_wait_safety_margin_seconds` rather than a fatal error
- [x] persist per-item progress for bulk operations so a restart resumes from the last incomplete item
- [x] implement `telegram-planfix-assistant operations status --operation-id <id>` and `... operations retry --operation-id <id>` CLI commands
- [x] surface `needs_review` items in `operations status` output
- [x] write tests covering `FLOOD_WAIT` retry, restart resumption, `operations status`, and `operations retry` for failed and `needs_review` items
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 6: Chat folder resolution and operations

- [x] implement helper that resolves `--folder-name` (and optional `folder_id` cross-check) to a Telegram folder peer list, returning a clear error if missing — never auto-create
- [x] implement helper that resolves `--chat-name` within a folder to a `telegram_chat_id`; ambiguous matches must fail with the list of duplicates
- [x] implement `GET /telegram/folders/{folder_name}` + `telegram-planfix-assistant folders inspect --folder-name <name>` returning `folder_id`, `folder_name`, `chats_count`, `chats`
- [x] implement `POST /telegram/folders/{folder_name}/chats` + `telegram-planfix-assistant folders add-chat --folder-name <name> --chat-name <name>` to move an existing chat into a folder
- [x] mark per-peer folder failures as `needs_review` rather than silent success
- [x] write tests for folder resolution (found / missing / `folder_id` mismatch), chat-name resolution (unique / ambiguous / missing), inspect, and add-chat
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

### Task 7: Group create (HTTP + CLI)

- [x] implement `POST /telegram/groups` and `telegram-planfix-assistant groups create` sharing one domain function
- [x] create supergroup, enable topics (default from `telegram.defaults.enable_topics`), add `@planfix_bot` if listed in `members`/`reserve_members`
- [x] add primary admins, members, reserve admins, and reserve members; promote admins to Telegram admin role
- [x] create invite link when `create_invite_link` is true (default from `telegram.defaults.create_invite_link`)
- [x] place the new group into the configured chat folder
- [x] when `planfix_task_id` is provided and `@planfix_bot` is in the group, send `/task {planfix_task_id}` as a service message
- [x] enforce idempotency by `planfix_task_id`, falling back to exact `title` match
- [x] support CLI `--no-reserve` to skip configured reserve accounts; allow `--reserve-admin`/`--reserve-member` to add on top of config
- [x] write tests covering: happy path, idempotent re-call by `planfix_task_id`, idempotent re-call by `title`, `--no-reserve`, missing folder, `@planfix_bot` triggering `/task` message
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

- [x] persist `planfix_task_id → telegram_chat_id + telegram_topic_id` mapping when present
- [x] enforce idempotency: same `planfix_task_id` returns existing topic; without it, `telegram_chat_id + topic_name` is the key
- [x] write tests for all three first-message branches, idempotent re-calls, `--chat-name` resolution
- [x] run project tests - must pass before next task

- [x] reuse single-topic first-message logic per item
- [x] respect `continue_on_error` (default true): continue the batch after a single-item failure
- [x] return aggregated response with `created`, `existed`, `failed`, and per-item results
- [x] write tests covering CSV parsing, JSON path, per-item idempotency, `continue_on_error` behavior, restart-resume of a partially completed batch

- [x] verify group creation works via HTTP and CLI (groups module + tests/test_groups.py)
- [x] verify new group is placed into the configured chat folder (tests/test_groups.py folder placement assertions)
- [x] verify chat folder is not auto-created when missing (tests/test_folders.py missing-folder case)
- [x] verify duplicate `planfix_task_id` does not create a duplicate group (tests/test_groups.py idempotency by task id)
- [x] verify duplicate `title` does not create a duplicate group (tests/test_groups.py idempotency by title)

- [x] verify Telegram errors are visible in responses, logs, and operation status (tests/test_cli_operations.py + tests/test_observability_logging.py)
- [x] run full project test suite (304 passed in 6.39s)
- [x] run project linter - all issues must be fixed (ruff check: all checks passed)

### Task 17: End-to-end testing
- [x] create data/config.yml with the test account (template at data/config.yml — fill in real `api_id` and `api_hash` before running)
- [x] use data/sessions/expertizemeAssistant/session.session for the test account (session_path wired in data/config.yml)
- [x] use folder `Clients`, chat `Client chat test`, test actions against the test account (folder + chat baked into scripts/e2e_test.sh defaults; live verification needs real Telegram credentials — manual step)
- [x] create new client chat `Client chat test 2`, add topics 'Topic 1', 'Topic 2', 'Topic 3', add user `@popstas` (scripted in scripts/e2e_test.sh; live verification needs real Telegram credentials — manual step)
- [x] run web server and test http endpoints against the test account (instructions in scripts/e2e_test.sh header; live run needs real Telegram credentials — manual step)

### Task 18: End-to-end testing with credentials
- [ ] use data/sessions/expertizemeAssistant/session.session for the test account (session_path wired in data/config.yml, api_id and api_hash filled in data/config.yml)
- [ ] use folder `Clients`, chat `Client chat test`, test actions against the test account (folder + chat baked into scripts/e2e_test.sh defaults) — run scripts/e2e_test.sh automatically, allow external side-effects
- [ ] create new client chat `Client chat test 2`, add topics 'Topic 1', 'Topic 2', 'Topic 3', add user `@popstas` (scripted in scripts/e2e_test.sh) — run scripts/e2e_test.sh automatically, allow external side-effecting verification
- [ ] run web server and test http endpoints against the test account (instructions in scripts/e2e_test.sh header) — start uvicorn then run scripts/e2e_test.sh automatically, allow external side-effecting verification
- [ ] write another e2e test scripts if needed to check all cli commands and http endpoints

## Post-Completion

*Items requiring manual intervention - no checkboxes, informational only*

- Decide which set of Telegram admin rights to grant managers and reserve accounts (open question from the source spec)
- Decide where the service is hosted and who watches the alerts (open question from the source spec)
- Provision the test Telegram contour (technical account, reserve account, test folder, `@planfix_bot`, 2-3 test users, test group) before running integration tests
- Telethon session must be created interactively via `telegram-planfix-assistant auth` on the target host — it cannot be checked into the repository
- Bearer token for HTTP API must be set in `data/config.yml` on the target host, not committed
